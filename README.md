# Overview
Patients with chronic illnesses often have multiple health care providers and an overwhelming amount of appointments. I created an app to help keep these patients organized so they can receive the best possible care from their team. The app provides a place for them to keep track of upcoming appointments, who their providers are, and what questions they need answered at specific appointments. As a nurse who took care of patients with chronic illnesses, a primary caregiver to a chronically ill patient, and a patient myself, I deeply understand how hard it is to keep track of all these things. I also understand that providers are able to give the best care to patients that have the resources to be prepared.
